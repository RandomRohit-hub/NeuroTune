# 🎵 NeuroTune - Spotify Song Recommendation System

Welcome to **NeuroTune**, a machine learning-based project where I’ve recreated a simplified version of Spotify’s song recommendation engine. This system uses content-based filtering to suggest songs similar to the one selected by the user.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project aims to mimic how platforms like Spotify recommend songs to users based on their listening preferences. By leveraging natural language processing and similarity metrics, NeuroTune finds tracks that are sonically and thematically close to a selected song.

## 🔍 Features

- 🔎 Content-Based Recommendation using TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity
- 🎧 Song similarity based on metadata (like genres, lyrics, etc.)
- 🧠 Machine Learning/NLP-powered backend
- 📊 Clean and efficient data pipeline for processing music data

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 🐍
- Pandas 📊
- Scikit-learn 🤖
- NLP (TF-IDF Vectorization)
- Cosine Similarity for song comparison

## 📁 How to Use

1. **Clone the repo**  
```

git clone [https://github.com/RandomRohit-hub/NeuroTune.git](https://github.com/RandomRohit-hub/NeuroTune.git)
cd NeuroTune

```

2. **Install required libraries**  
```

pip install -r requirements.txt

````

3. **Run the recommender**  
Load the notebook or script and call the `recommendation('Your Song Title')` function.

## 📌 Example

```python
recommendation('Blinding Lights')
````

Returns a list of top 20 similar songs based on metadata and lyrical patterns.

## 🧠 Future Enhancements

* Integrate audio features (tempo, danceability, etc.) using Spotify API
* Add collaborative filtering
* Deploy as a web app using Streamlit or Flask
